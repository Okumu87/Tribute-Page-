        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
          Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
          sister, Asim Zohra, followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu
          Meera Lebbai Maraikayar,Mustafa Kalam and Kasim Mohammed He was
          extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
          throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to
          his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor. Kalam was
          noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a
          television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 a.m. or 7 a.m. and
          sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books,
          his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his
          death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest
          brother, who survived him.

          The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial[118] was built in

          and missiles which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his
          life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the
          life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the entrance
          showing him playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of
          the leader in sitting and standing posture.[121]

        <h2>LifeStyle</h2>
        <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
          Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
          Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
          Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
          local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
          His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
          between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam
          was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
          family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders
          and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
          Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and
          Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
          family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
          and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
          between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
          to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
          fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
          ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
          born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
          meager income. [19][20][21] In his school years, Kalam had average
          grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
          strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
          Mathematics.[21] After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher
          Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint
          Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University
          of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to
          Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
          Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the
          Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to
          revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next
          three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later
          said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a
          difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of
          becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
          eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]
